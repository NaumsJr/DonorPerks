# DonorPerks
This is the code repository for NaumsJr's DonorPerks plugin!

There is no current license and at the moment you may not copy, redistribute or modify anything in here without permission from me (NaumsJr). The reason for this is I am mainly focusing on the coding before thinking about that and it gives me full control. If you notice any errors in my code contact me or raise a bug in the issues section and i may add you as a contributor and create a license when need be.
